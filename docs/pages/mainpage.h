 *
 *  cppfreetype is a C++ wrapper around the FreeType2 library. It is a simple,
 *  thin wrapper that doesn't do much on it's own. I wouldn't consider it
 *  very useful except to vain C++ programs who want the font config objects
 *  to be nicely namespaced and to eliminate the FT_ macros from their code.
 *
 *  cppfreetype mostly just provides objects which wrap freetype pointers
 *  with the methods of the underlying object
